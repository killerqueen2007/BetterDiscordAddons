## What It Does
AutoQuest is a BetterDiscord plugin that automatically opens Discord’s **Discover** page and completes quests for you. Basically, it:  

1. Opens **Discover** on Discord startup.  
2. Clicks the **Quests** tab.  
3. Finds uncompleted quests.  
4. Auto-enrolls you in them.  
5. Fakes progress for different quest types (watching videos, playing on desktop, streaming, etc.) until they’re done.  

> ⚠️ Use at your own risk. It interacts with your Discord token and may violate Discord’s rules.  

## Settings
- **Discord App:** Pick your Discord version (Stable, PTB, or Canary).  
- **Token:** Enter your Discord token so the plugin can enroll quests automatically.  

## How to Use
1. Install the plugin in BetterDiscord.  
2. Open Discord.  
3. Wait a few seconds – AutoQuest will handle the rest.  
4. Watch the console to see which quests are being completed.  

## Notes
- Works in Discord Desktop app for certain quests.  
- Some tasks may require the desktop app to fake “playing” or “streaming.”  
- Automatically stops when all quests are completed.
